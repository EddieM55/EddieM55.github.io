    <p><center>Heres a quick list of things I love and I will elatborate more afterwards. </center></p>
    <break></break>
    <center><ul>
      <li>I love Music</li>
      <li>I love Reading</li>
      <li>I love Professional Wrestling</li>
      <li>I love Life!</li>
    </ul></center>

      <p><center>Alright. Lets get to it. Music has always been apart of my life. Gospel, R&B and Hip-Hop have been apart of my life. Micheal Jackson has been my favorite artist for as long as I can remember. I got a story from elementary school where my music taste changed, but that isnt necessary right now. I got plenty of books related to music. SPEAKING OF BOOKS..</center></p>
      <break>
        <p><center>I've been reading forever. I was reading for fun for a good amount of time. I even won an award in kindergarten because I read 100 books that school year. But reading did get less fun when I was forced to do it for grades. But Im back loving it, and I have more variety in my selections. I've been reading alot of comic books and graphic npovels along with building up my personal library with poetry, photography and cool collectors books. OK, last thing before the top 5s.</center></p>
        <break>
          <p><center>I remember when I first saw wrestling for the first time. It was Kane when he was unmasked probably in the late 2000's. Since then, I've been on and off with wrestling, but never hated it. But I got back again in late 2022. Since then I've been keeping up with everything. Also, Ive been going to wrestling shows and its so cool to go in person and feel the energy of the crowd. Alright. Thats it. Onto the lists. </center></p>
